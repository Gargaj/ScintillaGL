Building
===================================

Code is windows only, to build use ScintillaGL.sln with MSVC2010.



Demo keys
===================================

* F5 - compile current shader and link current program
* F11 - show/hide shader editor layout
* Alt-F4 - exit program

License
===================================

It's complicated, but all my code should be under zlib license. All original code, even if it is modified by me, I think is still under scintilla license, so not sure.
Scintilla is licensed under some very permissive license.
